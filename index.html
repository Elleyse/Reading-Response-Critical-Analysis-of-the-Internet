            Reading Response:
            <p>
                I found this reading interesting because of Louise Drulhe’s first hypothesis. Thinking of the internet as one “single point” with the whole world is something I never considered. This idea of wholeness with one point makes me wonder how concrete the internet is. Is the internet as abstract as the reading depicts? 
	Relating to the first reading “The Handmade Web” by J. R. Carpenter, this reading makes me think about how Google owns so many other services. It makes me find more importance of the handmade web and how Google is a part of the reason why the internet is so corporate. I like the idea of the internet being an infinite web of networks and cites, making everything individual while being a part of a huge cosmic collection of cites and pages.
